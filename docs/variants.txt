Notation:
Na, Nm, Nc, Nh : the number of blocks of associated data, plaintext, ciphertext, and hash message, respectively.

v1: spoc64

a. Design goal
Support for authenticated encryption, decryption.
Basic iterative architecture to optimize throughput to area ratio.
No BRAMs, no DSP units.
All RAMs using asynchronous read.

b. Supported maximum sizes of inputs
Not evaluated.

c. Reference software implementation

spoc64sliscplight192v1

d. Non-default values of generics and constants
None

e. Block sizes

AD block size = 64 bits
Plaintext/Ciphertext block size = 64 bits

f. Execution times

Execution time of authenticated encryption:
        219 + (Na*109) + (Nm*111)

Execution time of authenticated decryption:
        219 + (Na*109) + (Nc*111)
